### Hello! Fancy seeing you here!

My name is Taras Ivashchuk and I am a machine learning developer, building data products from the ground up across a wide variety of industries and applications. I am also a friendly human and like making new friends and helping out on cool open-source projects, so if there's anything you want to ask or talk to me about, feel free to reach out anytime! ðŸ˜„

_Here are some ideas to get you started:_

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on buiding an [open-source, profitable algorithmic trader](https://github.com/tarasivashchuk/MarketML) to generate passive income for me and anyone else who wants to use it (and other projects, but that's for my job)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have two kittens named Pebbles and Nibbles
